Yes, you're right! Next.js is a more powerful framework compared to React, primarily because it has server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) built in, which React does not have by default.

Here's a breakdown of the key differences:

1. **React**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It focuses primarily on the client-side rendering (CSR). When you build a React app, it typically runs in the browser, and the browser downloads and renders the content.
    
2. **Next.js**: Next.js is a framework built on top of React, and it adds a lot of powerful features, including:
    
    - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: This means that pages are rendered on the server before being sent to the client, which improves SEO and performance, especially for dynamic content.
    - **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: You can pre-render pages at build time, making it super fast for static websites, and it can also generate static content that doesn’t need to be dynamically fetched on the server.
    - **API Routes**: Next.js allows you to create server-side API endpoints directly in the same project, so you can have both front-end and back-end in one place. You don’t need an external server like Express for that.
    - **Automatic Code Splitting**: Next.js automatically splits the code to optimize performance, meaning only the necessary code for the page being viewed is loaded.
    - **File-based Routing**: Next.js uses a file-based routing system, making it easier to manage routes without manually defining them.

In short, Next.js extends React by offering both server-side and client-side rendering, API routes, and other optimizations, making it a more powerful and full-fledged solution for building web applications.
